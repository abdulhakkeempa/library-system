# Library Management System

[Frappe Dev Hiring Test](https://frappe.io/dev-hiring-test)

Recently, I came across a Dev Hiring Test on the Frappe Career Page to build a library management system using any web framework in Python. I was curious to see how tech companies have changed their hiring tactics, and I observed that many college students prioritize academic grades over practical skills, leaving essential abilities behind. Therefore, I decided to take on this challenge and build the web application using my favorite web framework, Django.


Gratitude to [Frappe](https://frappe.io/) for providing the inspiring Dev Hiring Test ❤️
